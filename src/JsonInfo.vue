    <strong>JSON</strong> (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
    It is easy for humans to read and write.
    It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
    It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
    JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
    These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

    JSON is built on two structures:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.</li>
    <li>An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These are universal data structures.
    Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another.
    It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.
